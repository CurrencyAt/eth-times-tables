# eth-times-tables
Multiplication tables test example using Ethereum.

A very simple Ethereum Solidity and node.js/truffle/web3 program I wrote to begin learning to develop smart contracts.  Please fo not take anything in this program as a best practice.  This is based on the Truffle "pet shop tutorial" found at https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorials/pet-shop  Set up of Truffle and Ganache would be similar to the instructions there.

The parts of the program are an Ethereum personal blockchain for testing (Ganache), a Truffle application for creating and compiling smart contracts, and a node.js/web3.js web application for creating an interface, and a web browser equipped with metamask or a similar Ethereum wallet solution.
